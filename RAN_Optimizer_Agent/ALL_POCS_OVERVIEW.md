## 🎤 **Recommended Presentation Strategy**

### **Option 1: Start with Multi-Vendor (Recommended)**
1. Show multi-vendor coordination POC (4 min)
2. Explain unique market position
3. Discuss KSA market fit
4. Mention healing agent as follow-on

**Why This Works:**
- Most unique value proposition
- Perfect timing for KSA market
- Clear competitive moat
- Strong business case

---

### **Option 2: Lead with Healing Agent**
1. Show autonomous healing POC (4 min)
2. Emphasize immediate ROI
3. Discuss operational efficiency
4. Present pilot roadmap

**Why This Works:**
- Universal pain point
- Fastest to market
- Clear cost savings
- SaaS recurring revenue

---

### **Option 3: Show Both (8-10 minutes)**
1. Start with Multi-Vendor Coordination (3 min)
   - "Here's what makes us unique..."
2. Then show Autonomous Healing (3 min)
   - "Here's what solves immediate pain..."
3. Position as complementary platform (2 min)
   - "Build both on same infrastructure"
4. Discuss market opportunity (2 min)
   - "$10M+ total addressable market in KSA"

**Why This Works:**
- Shows breadth of capability
- Addresses multiple pain points
- Larger market opportunity
- Platform approach = higher valuation

## 💡 **My Recommendation**

**For your committee presentation, I recommend:**

### **Present Multi-Vendor Coordination as PRIMARY:**
- Most unique
- Perfect market fit for KSA
- Strong differentiation
- Clear competitive moat

### **Mention Autonomous Healing as SECONDARY:**
- Complementary solution
- Additional revenue stream
- Faster market entry
- Operational focus

### **Position as PLATFORM:**
- "We're building a multi-agent platform for network intelligence"
- "Two initial products, more to come"
- "Addressable market: $10M+ in KSA alone"

**Total Presentation Time:** 10-12 minutes
- Multi-Vendor: 5 minutes
- Healing Agent: 3 minutes
- Platform Vision: 2 minutes
- Q&A: 2 minutes
